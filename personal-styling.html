                        <p>Your appearance directly affects your credibility, capabilities, behavior, body language and the perception others might have of you.  When used properly, your clothing and grooming acts as a resourceful tool that will help you achieve personal and professional success. When you first meet someone, you have 3 seconds to present a powerful personal or professional image.  It is within this time frame that your observer will use their "gut feeling" to judge you. Since most people base first impressions on "the power of the glance," it is imperative to have a powerful appearance or an image that best relates to your individuality, credibility and personality. Work with me on creating the best you.</p>
